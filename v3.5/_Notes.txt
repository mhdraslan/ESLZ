-Execution Phases
1. Call Main
2. Call Environment Definitions
3. Call Resource Customizations (it needed)
4. Call Resource Templates


-Fixes
Make VNet names variables in deeper levels. Can use the Suffix option to standarize
Make RG names variables
Configure Tags
Configure peerings to enable the "Use Remote Gateway" options
Put conditions in ARM templates to check if a component should be deployed or not such as the Azure Firewall

Readjust the peerings templates so that there is a spoke template and multiple spoke parameter files
Readjust the routing templates so that the Powershell variables are replaced at the top level templates

Need to create a Template Spec to add VRF Subnet

Make the VM Series, Local Administrator username and password variables

The vNetName in building VM templates needs to be a variable, as if the structure of the name changes in the VNet creation templates, it will not be reflicted in the VM templates

Create a templates object that is passed down all the way to all sub templates to make it easy for using them in sub templates
